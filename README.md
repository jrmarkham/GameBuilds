Game Builds in Flash Builder using Starling and Feathers UI multiple configurations

THE ME Builds scale the stage from a set size based on a background image. I did this so the dimesion of the stage won't skew the background image. The backgorund image maybe be a larger scale than the rest of the conent is your game stage has a different ratio than you background. If you have elements in you background that need to be display in full height then create a very wide background and do the reverse if you need full width.
